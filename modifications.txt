Modification Proposal:

1. **Objective:**
   Reduce the size of the main window to improve the user interface and optimize screen space.

2. **Current Configuration:**
   The main window is currently set to the size of 700x550 pixels using the following code:

   root.geometry("700x550")

   Proposed Change:
Update the size of the main window to a more compact dimension. For example:
root.geometry("600x400")
#This change aims to create a more streamlined and efficient user interface while maintaining readability and usability.
